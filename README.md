## Script Files
- /bin/fitbit.py - Python class for handling data and token requests
- /bin/access_generator.py - Command line utility for gaining initial access to your Fitbit account data
- /bin/CherryPy-4.0.0.egg - Egg file for token verification. Prevents install of requests in your Splunk Environment
- /bin/requests-2.0.0-py2.7.egg - Egg file for requests. Prevents install of requests in your Splunk Environment
- /bin/*&lt;endpoint type&gt;*.py - Worker files for ingesting different data sources from Fitbit

## Requirements
- Python Requests2 - Egg file provided
- CherryPy - Currently there is an issue loading this module dynamically. You can install this manually, or using pip: "sudo pip install cherrypy==4.0.0"

#### ToDo
- Add advanced config to setup
- Fix CherryPy module issue

## Installation Instructions

### Preparation
Before using this TA, you must create a Fitbit app at [https://dev.fitbit.com](https://dev/fitbit.com) using the _Personal_ App type. This will provide you with all the necessary OAuth2 credentials required to gain access to your data. Additionally, the *Personal* will allow you to gain access to the intraday time series information used by this TA's Activity and Heart Rate monitoring. Please see the Fitbit Application documents on the Fitbit web site for information on completing this step. Be sure to have the callback URL to http://127.0.0.1:8080.

### Install the TA in Splunk
Install the TA on your Splunk indexers via any Splunk provided means. Install from file is preferred, however any installation procedure can be followed. If you are unfamiliar with Splunk app installation see the following [Splunk Answers Post](https://answers.splunk.com/answers/51894/how-to-install-a-splunk-app.html). Then restart Splunk in order to continue installation.

Next, configure the setup of the TA by navigating to _http://**mysplunkserver**:8000/en-US/manager/search/apps/local_ and select the **"Setup App"** option for the TA. This screen provides the OAuth2 setup information required to obtain data from Fitbit.

_**Advanced Config:** $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/default/appconfig.conf contains additional advanced setup information. These settings can be copied to the /local/appconfig.conf file for further tweaking of the TA. All advanced information in the default/appconfig.conf file have been commented. This configuration information will eventually be added to the setup file._

#### Create Access Token:
Run the __access_generator.py__ from your terminal or command line located in the _$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/bin_ folder. This file creates the necessary access tokens and permissions in order for the Technology Addon to consume user data. This utility requires that you have already configured during the setup steps previously performed within your Splunk environment. Run the following commands in your terminal:

    cd $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/bin/
    chmod +x access_generator.py
    splunk cmd python access_generator.py

1. The __access_generator__ will provide a browser window with a code. Copy this code to your clipboard. Note that the URL to open will be output in the terminal as well in case you are running Splunk on a separate server and accessing this remotely. If you are doing so, be sure to set up a SSH tunnel before doing so (ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:8080 USER@SPLUNKHOST). See screenshot:
![Access Generator Code](/../master/static/CodeRef.png?raw=true "Access Generator Code")

2. At the prompt in the __access_generator__ utility, paste the code that you copied from the previous step:
![Access Generator Prompt](/../master/static/RunAccessGen.png?raw=true "Access Generator Prompt")

3. Once the code has been submitted then you should see the screenshot below:
![Access Generator Complete](/../master/static/Complete.png?raw=true "Access Generator Complete")

When the process above has been completed, you should see a file called __user_settings.txt__ has been created in the _$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/bin_ directory. This file contains all the required access and refresh tokens needed to access your Fitbit account information.

### Configure local/inputs.conf
The final installation step is to configure your __inputs.conf__ file that tells Splunk which data to request from your Fitbit account. To configure this, you must first create a __local__ folder in the _$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/_ directory. This __local__ directory is where you will make specific changes to your TA-fitbit environment.

A sample __inputs.conf__ file has been provided in the _$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-fitbit/default/_ directory. Please note that the scripts in the default file have been disabled and you will need to turn the _disabled=true_ setting to _false_ in each stanza. Please follow the guidance in the __default/inputs.conf__ file for more information.

Now restart Splunk and you should start receiving data within a few minutes!

### Index Location and User Roles
This TA will create a standard index called __fit__ inside your indexer(s). The permissions to view this index by default have already been added to the __fit_analyst__ role created during the installation process. You will need to assign this role to any user account that would need access to your fitbit data. By design, this role will not have access to perform the TA setup operations inside of __Manage Apps__, and only the Admin will have this capability.
